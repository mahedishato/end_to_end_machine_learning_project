# Boston House Price Prediction Project

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting Boston house prices using machine learning. The entire workflow includes data loading, preprocessing, feature engineering, regression modeling, creating a Flask API, and Dockerizing the application.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following sections:

1. **Data Loading:**
   - The dataset used for this project is [provide dataset source/link].
   - The data loading script is located at [path/to/script].

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Data preprocessing steps are documented in [path/to/preprocessing/script].

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Feature engineering is conducted in [path/to/feature/engineering/script].

4. **Regression Modeling:**
   - The regression model is implemented in [path/to/regression/model/script].

5. **Flask API:**
   - A Flask API for the model is created in [path/to/flask/api/script].
   - API documentation and usage instructions are provided in [path/to/api/documentation].

6. **Dockerization:**
   - The Docker file is available at [path/to/docker/file].
   - Instructions for building and running the Docker container are outlined below.

7. **Version Control:**
   - The project is version-controlled using Git.
   - The `.gitignore` file is properly configured to exclude unnecessary files.

## How to Run

Follow these steps to run the project:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
   - Execute the data loading script.
   - Run the data preprocessing script.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Execute the feature engineering script.

3. **Regression Modeling:**
   - Run the script for building the regression model.

4. **Flask API:**
   - Launch the Flask API using the provided script.

5. **Dockerization:**
   - Build the Docker image using the following command:
     ```bash
     docker build -t boston-house-prediction .
     ```
   - Run the Docker container using the following command:
     ```bash
     docker run -p 5000:5000 boston-house-prediction
     ```
   The Flask API will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.
